"Diggity dig it dog"
A Simple game created and designed based on elements of the classic games battleship and minesweeper. This game randomly places mines and gold throughout the board game that players then are able to "dig up" by clicking boxes in the window. The game focuses on speedily clicking through the boxes while trying to collect as much gold as possible- and avoiding the mines while you are at it, since the mines remove a life from your beginning total of 3 lives. 

Benchmark: So far, the game works. The basic functions are all running and working as planned, with a few future additions that I'd like to add in the future still in mind. Currently finding gold adds 10 points to the score, stacking with each found gold chunk. I would like to add a high-score window that displays past scores from previous plays. This ended up being too much for the deadline though so it stays as a possible future addition. 

Errors: ...Don't worry, those aren't bugs. They are features.
